# copir

This is a semiautomation tool written in nodewbkit.
This tool allows copying of multiple files from one branch of a repository to other, so that users do not have to manually go
into each subdirectory and copy the required file and then navigate back to other branch and paste there. Instead, just provide a
list of files needed to be copied and Voilà, the job is done!
